# RetCare: Towards Interpretable Clinical Decision Making through LLM-Driven Medical Knowledge Retrieval

RetCare is a workflow designed to enhance the interpretability and reliability of clinical decision-making models. By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and large language models (LLMs), RetCare integrates authoritative medical literature to validate machine learning outputs, providing detailed and interpretable reasoning to support clinical decisions.

## Features

- **Integration of Authoritative Medical Knowledge**: Uses PubMed to validate prediction results and feature importance.
- **Comprehensive Prompting Strategies**: Develops prompts to integrate model outputs with healthcare context.
- **Interpretable Reasoning Capacities**: Provides detailed explanations and refined predictions using LLMs.
